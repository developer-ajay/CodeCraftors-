1. What is a class in Python, and how is it defined in code?

A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects, 
representing a collection of attributes and methods that define the behavior 
and properties of the objects. It is defined using the `class` keyword 
followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, methods and attributes are 
defined to specify the functionality and characteristics of the objects. Here is a simple example:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.make} {self.model}")

# Creating an instance of Car
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Maruti Suzuki")
car1.display_info()  # Output: Toyota Camry
